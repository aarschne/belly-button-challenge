I worked on this code by myself, although I did watch William Vann's review session 1 on javascript and used his code snippet for making the dropdown list. That is in my app.js file, and it is in line 18 to 28, in my populateDropDown function.

The index.html is the main file, and it references my app.js javascript file. The app.js file contains the logic that creates the page.
